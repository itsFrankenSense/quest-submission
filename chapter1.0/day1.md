## Quest

**1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp**
- A blockchain is a distributed network of computers used to process and store 'blocks' of transactions. These blocks are stored in an imutable ledger that can be referenced in the future.
- Some key features of a blockchain are;
<br> **Transparency** - On most blockchains, you can easily see who did what and when (including specific transaction information)
<br> **Decentralised** - No one person has control of the ledger on the network; any can interact with the network.
<br> **Efficient** - There is no need for a 'middle-man' in a transaction.

**2. Explain what a Smart Contract is. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts**
- A Smart Contract is a set of instructions for handling information on that network. This information can range from data about NFTs to who is allowed to access certain funds at what times (you can do a lot)!
- Smart Contracts can be powerful, so it's always recommended to handle them with care when creating or interacting with any.

**3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.**
- A __script__ is used to access information that is stored publicly on , and a __transaction__ is used to alter information stored on the Blockchain. Anytime something is changed, as opposed to view, a transaction fee is involved.
