**1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?**
<br> Safety and Security
<br> Clarity
<br> Approachability
<br> Developer Experience
<br> Resource Oriented Programming

**2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?**
<br> These pillars provide a nice overview of what Flow is focusing on with their network and why someone may consider building their product on Flow. The team at Dapper Labs has had experience working with other networks in the past and understand what it will take to be successful.
